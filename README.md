# BinaryTree-naivesort

This program implements an almost  complete  binary  tree.  It  is designed  to  implement a naive sort algorithm. The complete binary tree is created using an array as it the most efficient data  structure to implement the  na√Øve  sort algorithm. This algorithm can be used to sort any list of integers in ascending order.
